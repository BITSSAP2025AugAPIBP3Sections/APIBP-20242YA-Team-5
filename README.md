# **Student Certificate Verification System**

The application provides APIs for issuing and verifying student certificates using digital signatures and cryptographic verification.  
Universities can publish certificate details securely, and employers can instantly validate authenticity without contacting the university.



## **Backend**
Handles business logic and communicates with the database and cryptographic services.  
Exposes **REST and GraphQL APIs** for operations such as certificate issuance, record management, and verification.



## **REST & GraphQL API**
Acts as the bridge between frontend clients and the certificate verification layer. Supports operations like:

- **User authentication & role-based access** (university, student, employer)  
- **Certificate management** – create, update, and retrieve certificate records  
- **Digital signature & hash generation** – compute certificate hash (e.g., SHA-256) and cryptographic signatures  
- **Verification** – validate a certificate by ID or verification code  

Clients can choose:
- **REST endpoints** for standard HTTP requests  
- **GraphQL queries/mutations** for flexible data fetching and combined operations  



## **Core Features**

### **University (Issuer)**
- Authenticate and issue certificates  
- Store certificate hash and digital signature in secure database  

### **Student (Holder)**
- Retrieve issued certificate details and verification information  

### **Employer (Verifier)**
- Verify certificate authenticity directly through REST or GraphQL endpoints  



## **System-Wide**
- Authentication and role-based access control  
- Secure digital signing and cryptographic hashing  
- Tamper-proof verification accessible via both REST and GraphQL APIs
